Conversion Program
------------------

This simple conversion program converts units of distance or mass
to another unit of distance or mass respectively. To run this program
simply download all the files to a single directory (folder) and type "make"
to compile the program. The executable will have a default name of "a.out".
If you're using an IDE such as MS Visual Studios you'll need to download all
the files to a single folder and compile acordingly.
